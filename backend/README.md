# Optimizely Take-Home Assignment
Dear candidate, congratulations on reaching this stage in your recruitment journey with Optimizely!

In this repository, you will find the "backend" code for two AI-powered assistants (chatbots): Grumpy and Poet. 
To begin, try to launch them and have a quick chat to understand what they do. You will also be provided with a dedicated API key to access the OpenAI API.

## Your tasks will be the following:
1. Run the assistants, examine the provided code, and understand what they do.
2. Pick one assistant and generate a REST API that will allow the front end to communicate with it.
3. Prepare a suitable UI for this assistant (something like the ChatGPT interface) and connect it to your API.
4. Make it easily shareable and demonstrable with the team (e.g., create a Dockerfile with instructions so that we can run it inside a container, deploy it to some free hosting, or make a standalone app).

## Extra Tasks:
1. Try to do the same with the other assistant.
2. Create a UI where you can switch between the two assistants (again, similar to the ChatGPT interface).
3. Feel free to go creative and introduce some extra features that you think might make sense (e.g., "login page," feedback, file upload).

## Other Comments:
1. You don't have any time restrictions, but please keep track of how much time you've spent on the task to share with us. We will schedule a call with you about a week after this task was shared.
2. Don't stress about any part of the taskâ€”if something doesn't work as you intended, just leave it as is :)
3. You will need to present your results to the team. Make it in a way that's comfortable for you: either a live walkthrough or a PowerPoint presentation.
4. But, share the results with us beforehand, so we can try it out before the call.
5. You can fork from this repo or work in a branch, whatever you prefere.

## Good luck!
